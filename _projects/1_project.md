In this data-driven world, it is well-known that the performance of a data-driven optimization model for finding insightful population information depends on the quality of the data features. But there is tension regarding privacy, how "safe" a person of that population feels about sharing his private data with the world. Focusing on preserving individual participants' privacy and gaining their trust, we worked on developing a privacy-preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). More specifically, we developed the privacy-preserving non-negative matrix factorization using the Differential Privacy algorithm. As there's no such thing as a free lunch - the system model has to sacrifice its performance/utility (compared to a non-privacy-preserving setup) to give privacy to individual data participants. To make life easier for the system designers, we showed the analysis of the utility gap vs. privacy parameter so that one can choose one's privacy guarantee based on the tolerance of utility loss.
